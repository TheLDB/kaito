# Routers

Routers hold all of our routes and their metadata. They can be merged together to allow for separating logic into different files.

## Creating a Router

When using `createUtilities`, you get a `router` function that you can use to create a new router. This can be called as many times as you like, and you can merge routers together with a prefix to create a larger router.

```ts {1,3}
import {createUtilities} from '@kaito-http/core';

export const {getContext, router} = createUtilities(async (req, res) => {
	// ...
});

const app = router().get(...);
```

And then you are safe to use the `router` function around your app, which will guarantee context type safety.

## Router Merging

Routers can be merged, which brings one router's routes into another, with a prefix. This is incredibly useful for larger apps, for example when you have multiple versions of an API.

```ts {4}
import {v1} from './routers/v1';
import {v2} from './routers/v1';

export const api = router().merge('/v1', v1).merge('/v2', v2);
```

You can expect all type information to be carried over as well as the route names and their prefixes.
